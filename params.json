When you download Splunk Enterprise for free, you get a Splunk Enterprise license for 60 days that lets you index up to 500 megabytes of data per day.\r\n\r\nWhen the free trial ends, you can convert to a perpetual Free license or purchase an Enterprise license to continue using the expanded functionality designed for multi-user deployments.\r\n\r\n##Dashboards\r\n\r\n###System Info\r\n\r\nThis Dashboard contains information on the FreeNAS system(s)\r\n\r\n![Example Dashboard](https://static.dyp.im/gKpG2D91QX/62eb965b0f5b06c26b89d52beaa078e5.png)\r\n\r\n##Inputs\r\n\r\n###.SH\r\nThere are several .sh scripts in /TA-SH_files_for_FreeNAS directory that need to be placed on a persistent dataset on the FreeNAS server with a cron job associated with them, set to run every few minutes.\r\n\r\nhttps://doc.freenas.org/9.3/freenas_tasks.html\r\n\r\nthese scripts output to “logger” - which is the syslog output\r\n\r\nalso once copied over this may be your friend :)\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nchmod 777 foo.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Syslog\r\n\r\nYou need to configure FreeNAS to log to a central server (Splunk®) for the data to be ingested, point to port 1514 e.g. \r\n\r\n\t192.168.1.2:1514\r\n\r\nhttps://doc.freenas.org/9.3/freenas_system.html#general\r\n\r\n###Local Weather input (Optional)\r\n\r\nTo compare local temps with system temps I added a json API input via http://openweathermap.org\r\n\r\nIts free to signup - edit inputs.conf with your location information and appid (API key)\r\n\r\n\r\n##VERY IMPORTANT NOTE\r\n\r\n**This app is work in progress**\r\n\r\nPlease submit issues, improvements patches to github - http://j-c-b.github.io/freenas_splunk/\r\n\r\nApp is available directly on Splunkbase https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2940/#/overview\r\n\r\n##TODO\r\n\r\n* Snapshot script and dashboard for success / fail\r\n* ZFS related goodness for pools and datasets\r\n* Improve dashboard search efficiency\r\n* Use ipmiOutput for host data input\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
